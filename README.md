This project implements a basic GPT-style model built using the Transformer architecture and trained on Shakespeare’s texts. It is a continuation of an earlier project and demonstrates strong performance for its level of complexity.
To run the program, install the required libraries and use the provided test file to evaluate the model.

Here is a sample answer:

    --- Generated Text ---
      Shepherd:
      O, were you so hot! I'll shown yon years;
      but will be shut, we shall not reason with you.
      
      Clown:
      Shall give you the masters of unruly reason?
      
      Shepherd:
      I had a bastard to have any man is, thus
      enters from good courtesy.
      
      Shepherd:
      So many I do, my heads as miserable and so leaves
      ta'en from the flood with wondering days; therefore,
      since the garies are given to my tune of arms,
      and giving no power to have when never bestrided
      a mistress of the people! make me you good.

I will be fine-tuning this on a personalized conversation and will create a different repository to push.
